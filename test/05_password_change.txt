Web Form:
https://hanamdcs0001142741trial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/sap/hana/xs/formLogin/login.html

Requests session status using:
https://hanamdcs0001142741trial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/sap/hana/xs/formLogin/checkSession.xsjs
Return:
{"login":false,"pwdChange":false}

When form is submitted firt a CSRF Token is requested via HTTP GET from
https://hanamdcs0001142741trial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/sap/hana/xs/formLogin/token.xsjs
Return Header Field: x-csrf-token
But is filled with "unsafe" as the user is not yet authenticated

Login data is provided via HTTP POST to
https://hanamdcs0001142741trial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/sap/hana/xs/formLogin/login.xscfunc
Form Data:
xs-username=ORGANIZER&xs-password=Init1234
Return:
{"login": true, "pwdChange": true}

Before posting old password and new password confirmation again the CSRF Token is requested via HTTP GET from
https://hanamdcs0001142741trial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/sap/hana/xs/formLogin/token.xsjs
and now the x-csrf-token header is filled correctly. So that header must be added also to the HTTP POST to

https://hanamdcs0001142741trial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/sap/hana/xs/formLogin/pwchange.xscfunc
Form Data:
xs-password-old=Init1234&xs-password-new=Test1234

No response but Status Code 200
